Read the paper [Working with date and time: http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i03/](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i03/)

Write a blog post addressing the questions:

- What are intervals, durations, periods, and instants?
- (Why) do we need these distinctions?



## Instructions:
Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post!

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository!
