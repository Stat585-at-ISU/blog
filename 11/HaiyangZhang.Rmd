## Background:

The ASA sections on Statistical Graphics and Statistical Computing are hosting a [video library](http://stat-graphics.org/movies/) of movies showcasing the 'state of the art' of the times. This library contains countless interesting insights into the history of computing and graphics. Watch J.W.Tukey demonstrate the  [Prim-9 system](http://stat-graphics.org/movies/prim9.html).

In the light of this video, write a blog post discussing the use of interactive graphics: how have you experienced interactive statistical graphics (and in which systems)? What operations do you consider to be part of interactive statistical graphics now?
